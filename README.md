# Fuzzy & PID controller (University Assignment)

Project: Fuzzy & PID controller for wall following Robot (Individual Project)

Technology: Pioneer Mobile Robot, Visual Studio, C++, Windows

Duration: 2 Â½ Months

Description: I implemented and tuned a PID controller using sensor values to perform the task that enabled a wheeled mobile robot to follow a straight wall and correcting itself along the way. I also designed and executed a Fuzzy Logic controller to follow a wall with corners and various layouts and to avoid randomly placed obstacles. These tasks were entirely coded in C++.
